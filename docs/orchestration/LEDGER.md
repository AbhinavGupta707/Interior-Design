# Orchestration Ledger

## Programme

- Active plan: `ai_native_architecture_blue_sky/docs/implementation/08_ACTIVE_BLUE_SKY_M1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- Integration branch: `main`
- Repository/project root: `/Users/abhinavgupta/Desktop/Interior Design`
- Remote: `https://github.com/AbhinavGupta707/Interior-Design.git`
- Worktree policy: project-scoped Codex worktree tasks only
- Worker runtime policy: explicit `gpt-5.6-sol` for every lane; `high` for bounded/straightforward work and `xhigh` for complex architecture, security, geometry, inference, concurrency, adversarial or integration-heavy work. Each checkpoint records the assignment before launch.
- Autonomous programme target: complete C1 through C10 sequentially; the immutable C1–C6 goal is followed immediately by a C7–C10 continuation goal
- Gate policy: no later checkpoint opens until code, contracts, security/data behavior, browser/UI/UX and applicable simulator/runtime evidence for the current checkpoint are integrated and recorded

## C0 — Repository and multi-surface delivery substrate

### Master activation and integration

- Status: complete on `main`; C1 not opened
- Contract: C0-v1
- Base commit: `652575f`
- Root/toolchain ownership: master/orchestrator
- Planned lanes: four

| Lane                    | Task/thread                            | Worker SHA | Merge SHA | State      | Exclusive paths                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C0-L1 platform/API      | `019f6d3d-1e35-7d61-978b-1983cffc422e` | `f054968`  | `bf2a522` | integrated | `services/platform-api/**`, `packages/config/**`                          |
| C0-L2 web/UI            | `019f6d3d-1e14-7fe0-9855-593be5018816` | `c9dc5a7`  | `31b4c34` | integrated | `apps/web/**`, `packages/ui/**`                                           |

| C0-L4 delivery/infra/QA | `019f6d3d-1e30-7952-831a-dc715e7d9ebe` | `09fa110`  | `bc5aa2d` | integrated | `infrastructure/**`, `tests/bootstrap/**`, `docs/runbooks/development/**` |

### Integrated gate evidence

- Frozen clean install succeeded with pnpm 10.33.0; `UV_CACHE_DIR=.cache/uv pnpm verify` passed formatting, ESLint, TypeScript, 16 JavaScript unit tests, production builds, Ruff, mypy and pytest.
- The provider-free infrastructure contract passed 15 bootstrap tests and Terraform validation. The lane also proved live loopback-only PostGIS, four signed S3 lifecycle buckets and Temporal cluster health, then stopped the containers.
- XcodeGen regeneration was stable and the merged iOS app passed 13 tests on the iPhone Air iOS 26.4 Simulator. Simulator output remains explicitly non-RoomPlan evidence.
- The merged API and production web processes passed the cross-surface localhost smoke contract. C0-L2 separately verified desktop and mobile browser layouts, navigation/recovery, semantics, overflow and zero console errors.
- Integration caught and fixed two cross-lane defects: the root formatter now excludes native DerivedData, and the bootstrap smoke uses the rendered `Home Design Studio` identity.
- No paid provider, cloud resource, public deployment, real customer data, LiDAR claim or GPU claim was activated.

## C1 — Identity, project and home intake

### Master activation

- Status: three isolated worker tasks active
- Contract: `docs/orchestration/checkpoints/C1_CONTRACT.md`
- Base commit: `1c9d439`
- Planned lanes: three
- Provider policy: local fixture plus disabled provider-neutral OIDC port; no external key required
- Data policy: deterministic two-tenant synthetic fixtures only
